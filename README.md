## 🚀 My DevOps Projects

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline for FastAPI with AWS EC2

* **Link:** [ci-cd-fastapi](https://github.com/fabien-devops/ci-cd-fastapi)
* **Tech:** FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, EC2
* **Description:** Automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. On each push, the app is linted, built into a Docker image, and pushed to Docker Hub. A CD workflow runs on a self-hosted EC2 runner, pulls the image, and redeploys the container.
* **Key Skills:** GitHub Actions, Docker, FastAPI, AWS EC2, CI/CD

---

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins + Terraform for AWS Java App

* **Link:** [terraform-jenkins-automation](https://github.com/fabien-devops/terraform-jenkins-automation)
* **Tech:** Jenkins, Docker, AWS (EC2, VPC, S3, IAM), Terraform, Java, Maven
* **Description:** Complete pipeline that builds a Java app, packages it in Docker, provisions AWS infrastructure using Terraform, and deploys the app on an EC2 instance using SSH and Docker Compose.
* **Key Skills:** Jenkins Declarative Pipeline, Shared Library, Docker, Terraform, IaC, Java, CI/CD

---

### 3. Kubernetes Cluster on AWS with Terraform (EKS)

* **Link:** [Terraform-EKS](https://github.com/fabien-devops/Terraform-eks)
* **Tech:** Terraform, AWS EKS, VPC, NAT Gateway, EC2
* **Description:** End-to-end provisioning of a scalable and modular Kubernetes cluster (EKS) with self-managed node groups, multi-AZ architecture, subnet tagging for ELB integration, and API access via Terraform provider.
* **Key Skills:** Terraform modules, EKS, VPC design, High Availability, K8s Networking

---

### 4. CI/CD to Kubernetes on GCP (GKE)

* **Link:** [cicd-to-k8s-gke](https://github.com/fabien-devops/cicd-to-k8s-gke)
* **Tech:** GitLab CI, Docker, Terraform, GCP, GKE, GCR
* **Description:** GitLab pipeline that builds a Docker image of a Python app, pushes it to GCR, provisions GKE infrastructure using Terraform, and deploys the app to Kubernetes using `kubectl`.
* **Key Skills:** GitLab CI/CD, Terraform GCP, GKE, Docker, K8s Deployment
